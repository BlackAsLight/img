# Img

Img is a repo containing implemenetations, made from scratch, of various image
formats offering the ability to encode and decode between them, and integrate
smoothly with various Web APIs like the Canvas. Where possible, we offer both
sync and streaming encoders/decoders.

## Missing a format?

If this repo is missing a format you'd like to work with, simply create an issue
suggesting the format, along with a link to the standard, specifcation or some
document that is essentally the source of truth for that format. Do that and it
might get an implementation here.
